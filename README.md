### Project under development

![Thermostat Image - NO IMAGE](image_link.png)

#### In Rio de Janeiro, temperatures can exceed 35Â°C on some days. As my house gets very hot, I decided to create a project to monitor the temperature remotely. This way, I could, from school, know how hot it would be and decide whether to go home or spend the afternoon studying at the mall.

## Prerequisites

- ESP8266-01S (it's possible to use other microcontrollers, but code changes may be necessary)
- Temperature Sensor [DS18B20 (Dallas)](https://pdf1.alldatasheet.com/datasheet-pdf/view/227472/DALLAS/DS18B20.html)
- 3.3V power supply
- Arduino IDE and necessary libraries
- Blynk account

## How to use

1. Connect ESP01S to Dallas-18B20 sensor
2. Choose a power source (3.3V) to power the ESP01S and the sensor
3. Configure the settings and make adjustments according to your preference in: `config.h`
4. Install the necessary libraries and load the firmware into the ESP01S
5. The thermostat will start working automatically
6. Log in to [Blynk](https://blynk.cloud) account

## Settings

In the `config.h` file it is possible to adjust some settings such as: Information for connecting to the Blynk server, network credentials for WiFi connection, the pin to which the sensor is connected and the intervals for reading and sending data.

## Libraries
- ESP8266WiFi
- BlynkSimpleEsp8266
- OneWire
- DallasTemperature

## Notes

It is important to highlight that it is not possible to view the temperature directly, requiring a previously configured WiFi connection so that the ESP8266-01S can communicate with the Blynk server. For a project with a similar objective that does not require an internet connection, I suggest using a microcontroller like the ATtiny85 and a display (TM1637).

I won't provide information about Blynk configuration, but I can tell you that you should use Datastreams and Virtualpins. For example: Temperature; V0

For information about Blynk, see https://docs.blynk.io/en

## Additional features
- ESP.deepSleep function
- ESPserver to configure the wifi connection
- Display (TM1637)
- Wi-Fi connection test using a button (green LED for connection established and red LED for disconnected)
- OTA: Firmware Over-The-Air updates
